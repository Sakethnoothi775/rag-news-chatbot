Police had been searching for the couple for 53 days after officers found evidence of a recent birth in a burnt-out car near Bolton.Passing sentence, Judge Mark Lucraft KC told the couple \"neither of you gave much thought to the care or welfare of your baby\" and said there had been \"no genuine expression of remorse\" from either of them.They were sentenced on the basis Victoria died of hypothermia - both defendants had argued against that during the hearing.Gordon will serve a further four years on extended licence, the judge said. There was no reaction from either defendant as they were sentenced.The first trial found Marten and Gordon guilty of concealing the birth of a child, perverting the course of justice by not reporting her death, and of child cruelty, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge.The court heard that, whem Marten was heavily pregnant, they had decided to live off grid to avoid Victoria being taken off them by social care authorities. Their four other children had previously been taken into care.During the police manhunt that spanned different parts of England once the circumstances of the birth were uncovered, the couple slept outside and took steps to avoid being found, such as taking long taxi rides that criss-crossed the country.They were eventually located on 27 February 2023, and Victoria was discovered dead two days later in an allotment shed in the Hollingbury area of Brighton.She had died while the couple were living in a tent on the South Downs in January that year.The chaotic lives of a couple who killed their baby daughterI've never seen a case like Constance Marten and Mark Gordon's - it was jaw-droppingWatch: How police traced Constance Marten and Mark GordonIn their trial, the couple had said Victoria's death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep holding the baby - but the prosecution called on evidence from experts on hypothermia, one of whom described the conditions the newborn would have experienced living in a tent in the middle of winter.During a months-long retrial, the judge said the couple tried to \"sabotage\" and \"manipulate\" proceedings.Firstly there were many days when one or other of them claimed illness, dental pain or just tiredness from travelling back and forth to court from their respective jail cells, causing proceedings to overrun by many months.When in court, both displayed di",

A bolt-action rifle was recovered near the shooting, and a screwdriver was found on the roof from where the fatal shot was fired.\"I can report today that the DNA hits from the towel that was wrapped around the firearm and the DNA on the screwdriver are positively processed for the suspect in custody,\" Kash Patel told Fox and Friends.A formal charge is expected this week.

In August, Trump escalated his fight against the Fed by attempting to firegovernor Lisa Cook, a move that a federal judgetemporarily blockedlast week.It's against this backdrop that Fed governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly stepped down last month, opening up a seat on the board that Trump has been so publicly seeking to influence. He quicklynominated Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to finish the remainder of her term, which runs through January 2026.PoliticsWhite House economist Stephen Miran likely to be confirmed to Fed board of governorsAt aSenate Banking Committee hearingearlier this month, Miran said that he would not resign his position as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers if he were confirmed to the role, but would take an unpaid leave of absence.That, coupled with some of his previous writings calling for less independence for the Fed, rattled Democrats in the room.\"Right now, the banking committee should be investigating the president's direct attacks on that independence, not pretending that it's business as usual,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., the committee's highest-ranking Democrat,told NPR in September.The committee ultimately voted 13-11 along party lines to advance Miran's nomination to the full Senate. If confirmed, as expected, Miran would join the Fed in time for its highly anticipated two-day meeting on interest rates, which begins Tuesday.\"This is setting us up for a very tight process in advance of a very important central bank meeting,\" Lisa Gilbert, the co-president of the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, told NPR.Interview highlightsSen. Warren says banking panel should focus on Trump's attacks on Fed independenceBut critics are worried about more than just the timing. They say his unprecedented plan to take unpaid leave from the White House rather than resign altogether is alarming, warning it could give the president undue influence at the Fed, which is supposed to operate independently of the administration.\"It functionally means he remains a White House employee at the same time as working for the importantly independent Federal Reserve,\" Gilbert said. \"So we're really conce",

He added that President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping would \"speak on Friday to complete the deal.\"Trump posted on social media: \"A deal was also reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!\"China's state news agency Xinhua called the talks in Spain \"candid and in-depth,\" but it was less clear about whether or not the end of the TikTok saga is in sight. It said the two sides had reached \"a basic consensus on a framework to properly resolve TikTok-related issues through cooperation, reduce investment barriers, and promote relevant economic and trade cooperation.\"Last year, Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled ApplicationsAct, which bans TikTok in the U.S. unless it is sold to a non-Chinese owner. The company is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. Former presidentBiden signed the billinto law and although TikTok sued, arguing that a ban violates users' free speech rights, the law wasupheld in early Januaryby the Supreme Court.It was slated to take effect only a few days later, but Trump signed an executive order that paused the ban on Inauguration Day. He subsequently issued two more executive orders extending the reprieve, which is expected to expire on Wednesday.Since then, the Trump administration has been trying to broker a deal for an American company, or companies, to buy TikTok from ByteDance in order to keep the app from going dark in the United States. But the issue has become wrapped up insweeping trade talksbetween Washington and Beijing that include strategically thorny topics like tariffs, fentanyl, microchips and rare earths.According to TikTok's data, in early 2024, the app was used by more than half of Americans.

Or if it's helping anyone, it's very few when everyone else is suffering.\"The interview, conducted over two sessions in recent weeks and published by the Catholic news site Crux on the his 70thbirthday, offer a first glimpse into Leo's personality and priorities.In his conversation with Crux's senior Vatican correspondent, Elise Ann Allen, Leo signaled continuity with his predecessor Pope Francis and the late pontiff's vision for dialogue and full participation in the church, known as synodality.Already positioning himself as a pope of reconciliation, Leo reflected on the reasons behind the deep polarization in society and the church today. He pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, but also a sense of loss of the value of human life as partly responsible for sectarianism and division.\"Add on top of that a couple of other factors, one which I think is very significant is the continuously wider gap between the income levels of the working class and the money that the wealthiest receive,\" he said.Shortly after his election on May 8, the pope said he took the name Leo because he was inspired by Pope Leo XIII, who addressed the stresses put on society by the Industrial Revolution in the late 18thcentury. Leo XIII's encyclical \"Rerum Novarum\" (On Revolutions) laid out the reasons for the church's support of the working class, fair wages and the right to unionize, while opposing communism and unbridled capitalism.In the Crux interview, Leo XIV questioned the disproportionate difference in the incomes of modern CEOs and those of their workers, and challenged the extreme wealth of billionaires – and trillionaires such as Elon Musk. \"What does that mean and what's that about? If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we're in big trouble.\"The pope called synodality, whose its roots are in Latin American church, the \"antidote\" to the deep divisions in the church and society, describing it as \"an attitude, an openness, a willingness to understand.\" He said that some church leaders feel \"threatened\" by synodality, because of what Leo called a mistaken understanding of their authority.

Scientists noticed it was starting toslide down the mountainfaster than it had in decades, on a trajectory so dangerous that they rapidly persuaded the local government to immediately evacuate the village's 300 people.A week later, as predicted, the glacier broke loose. Video shot by visitor Vitus Brenner shows the glacier crashing down the steep mountainside in a dramatic white cloud of ice, rock and sand. Achrainer was working in the hotel above the valley when the lights flickered and went dark. She went outside and hiked to a nearby cliff to see what had happened.\"It was beyond imagination,\" she says. \"The village is there, but there is no village.

Torres calls this an \"extinction moment for establishment politics\": that if politicians don't get serious about communicating with voters, and nonvoters, in all the digital spaces where people today get their information, and sometimes misinformation, they're unlikely to last long in the business.\"You get good at it or you become extinct.
