Their son Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was \"ecstatic and massively grateful\" to those who were involved in securing their release.The Taliban, who detained the couple on 1 February, said the pair had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings - but the Islamist group has never disclosed a reason for their detention.Peter and Barbie Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and spent the past 18 years running a charitable training programme that had been approved by local Taliban officials when the armed group reclaimed power in 2021.Therewere emotional scenes on Fridayas the couple's daughter, Sarah Entwistle, met her parents as they stepped off the plane in Doha.\"We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,\" Barbie told Agence France-Presse at Kabul airport after Qatar-brokered negotiations for their release.Their son Jonathan echoed those hopes, saying \"their desire would be to carry on living there and to do the work they were doing\".Watch: Hugs on the tarmac as family reunite in Doha after Afghan ordeal\"They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they've been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact,\" Jonathan told the BBC.He said a few weeks ago he had managed to share the results of \"really encouraging\" reports about their programmes with his parents over the phone.He said Barbie's initial reaction had been that they had \"more work to do\".\"But how do you do that in a country where you're not welcome,\" Jonathan added.Since 2009 the couple have been running training projects in Kabul and Bamiyan.One of their education projects involved training women and children, and had apparently been approved by local authorities, despite a Taliban ban on women working and education for girls over 12-years-old.ReutersTheir affection for Afghanistan was demonstrated by their decision to remain in Bamiyan province after the authoritarian regime seized control in August 2021, while many other Westerners left- including most of their staff.The couple's release follows months of public lobbying by their family, who have described the harrowing conditions of their detention.Jonathan said in July that his father had been suffering serious convulsions and his mother was \"numb\" from anaemia and malnutrition.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised the \"vital role\" played by Qatar in securing their release.A Qatari official told the BBC the couple were moved from Kabul",

You don't get a tick in the box if the name on the ballot paper means nothing to the voter clutching their stubby pencil in the voting booth.In the last couple of years the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, hasbungee-jumped,jet-skied, and even ridden a hobby horse into the public's imagination in a way that helped his party to success in the general election, surpassing their own hopes.He proved there is wisdom in playing the clown in politics - if it gets you attention. But too much clowning around might not look so smart.And while the government is unpopular, and the Conservatives seem miles from any kind of recovery, the Lib Dems have not been the main beneficiaries from their mutual misery.As the Lib Dems gather in Bournemouth this weekend for their annual get together, there will be a certain amount of understandable jollity.That's not just because of the Lib Dems' traditional glee club, or the fact that political activists enjoy their conferences the way that many of us might enjoy a minibreak with mates. It's a different kind, with warm, not cold, wine, and earnest discussions in stifling rooms, rather than a walk on the beach or a lie-in, although the budget hotels and deep fear of rail replacement services to get there are the same.But the Lib Dems are broadly in a good place after the general election, and they had moregains in council elections in May. They have dozens of new MPs, and a rebooted team on their front bench.The question hanging over their conference in Bournemouth this weekend is expressed by one of their MPs: \"Where do we go now, to make sure it's not a false start?\"In other words – what next, where, and how? No doubt, there is opportunity for the Lib Dems.Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesIn the words of one party insider: \"What are a lot of Labour people talking about? Plotting against the leader. What are a lot of Tory people talking about? Plotting against the leader.\"The two big parties are both partly distracted by their own woes, which could provide the Lib Dems plenty of political space.Look at the numbers and the map. In the general election the Lib Dems swept up 60 seats from the Conservatives – nearly all in the South.The party relentlessly focused on places where they had a decent shot at winning, rather than run vigorous campaigns in every corner of the country. They were, as a result, only in second place in 27 seats.They were also predominantly in the south of England, and 20 were won by the Conservatives.So if you follow the logic, the obvious next tranche of seats and voters for the Lib Dems to target are Tory-held parts of the country, and Tory-leaning voters.\"Look at what's happening on the right, there's a ferocious split, and the Tories are crumb",

Before Friday, there had been eight days with zero arrivals recorded.The government said it intends to increase the number of people being sent back under the pilot deal over the coming months.Next week, the first asylum seekers are expected to arrive in the UK from France under the reciprocal aspect of the deal.Follow BBC Kent onFacebook, onX, and onInstagram.

Russia's defence ministry says its \"massive strike\" used \"precision weapons\" and targeted military-industrial facilities.Separately, Russia says four people were killed in a Ukrainian drone attack on the Samara region. Kyiv says it hit a major oil refinery there.Ukraine also says another Russian oil refinery was damaged in the neighbouring Saratov region.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.In a post on social media, President Zelensky said Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy and Kharkiv regions were attacked by Russia overnight.He said \"residential areas and civilians facilities\" were hit.In the central city of Dnipro, the president added, there was a \"direct hit of a missile with cluster munitions on a high-rising residential building\".The BBC has verified footage uploaded this morning showing a missile in flight and an impact, as well as still images of a badly damaged building in the same location in Dnipro.In Russia, Samara regional Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev said four people were killed \"as a result of an overnight attack by enemy drones\".He said that another person was injured, without giving any other details.Ukraine's military said its drones struck the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery in the Samara region. It also said the Saratov oil refinery was hit overnight in the neighbouring region.Cross-border drone raids have become a prominent feature of the war. In July, a sustained Ukrainian drone attack forced thetemporary closure of all of Moscow's airports.Kyiv has been systematically targeting Russian oil and other key industrial facilities, which play a key role in Russia's continuing war effort in Ukraine.Meanwhile, Moscow has in recent weeks escalated its aerial assaults on Ukraine, while Kyiv and its Western allies - including the US - continue to call for a ceasefire.Earlier this month, the main government building was hit in Ukraine's capital Kyiv by what Ukraine said was a Russian Iskander cruise missile.Zelensky said on Saturday that he planned to meet US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), taking place in New York next week.Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last month, hoping to secure a deal on ending the conflict.

He signed a decree reviving the Soviet-era songfest with the aim of \"developing international cultural and humanitarian co-operation\".The more obvious objective is creating an international song contest in which Moscow can actually take part. In 2022 Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Ukraine says Intervision is an attempt to distract the world from Russia's ongoing invasionA pattern's emerging.When Team Russia was banned from the Olympic Games, Moscow tried to create alternatives, like the Games of the Future and the World Friendship Games.Now the Kremlin's come up with its own version of Eurovision.But what does it look like and who is taking part?For Intervision, the Russians have cast their musical net far and wide, inviting allies from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. The starting line-up reflects the political and economic alliances of which Russia is part, like the Brics group of nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Commonwealth of Independent States.The list of participating countries includes China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam, Venezuela, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar: a very different musical map from Eurovision, and an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that, despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia still has friends.The United States, too, is taking part: a sign of the thaw in US-Russian relations since Donald Trump's return to the White House.Thaw doesn't mean problem-free.

When Harjit Kaur's family arrived to see her, they could barely hear her - and the first words they caught shattered them.\"She said, 'I would rather die than be in this facility. May God just take me now',\" recalled her distraught daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur.Harjit Kaur, 73, who unsuccessfully applied for asylum in the US, and has lived in California for more than three decades, was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials on 8 September, sparking shock and sympathy from the Sikh community across the state and beyond.Harjit Kaur had filed several asylum appeals over the years which were rejected, with the last denial in 2012, her lawyer said.Since then, she had been asked to report to immigration authorities every six months. She was arrested in San Francisco when she had gone for a check-in.It comes amid a wider crackdown by the Donald Trump administration on immigration, and especially alleged illegal immigrants in the US.The issue is a sensitive one - the country is grappling with how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who arrive at its borders every year. More than 3.7 million asylum cases are pending in immigration courts. An increased budget for immigration enforcement means ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency.Trump has said he wants to deport the \"worst of the worst\", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted.\"Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction,\" said California State Senator Jesse Arreguin in a statement demanding Harjit Kaur's release. \"Now, they are literally going after peaceful grandmothers.

Attorney General Letitia JamesThe replacement of Siebert as U.S. attorney for the prestigious Eastern District of Virginia office comes amid a push by Trump administration officials to indict James, a perceived adversary of the president who has successfully sued him for fraud. President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday that he wanted Siebert \"out\" and multiple people familiar with the matter later told the AP that Siebert had informed his colleagues of his plan to resign from the position.The administration's effort to oust him from the job represents a further erosion of norms meant to insulate the Justice Department from White House influence on prosecutorial decisions. The move is likely to deepen concerns that the department — already investigating other public figures Trump regards as foes — is being weaponized by a White House seeking to have its prosecutorial powers used for purposes of retribution.It was not immediately clear Friday afternoon who would replace Siebert, who was nominated by Trump to the top job in the office this year after having worked there for more than a decade. Siebert's top deputy, Maya Song, is also leaving her position as first assistant U.S. attorney and will work as a line prosecutor, one of the people familiar with the matter said.Justice Department spokespeople declined to comment.Trump administration officials have been aggressively pursuing allegations against James arising from alleged paperwork discrepancies on her Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home.

Wang witnessed how the stringent COVID measures sparkedrare protestsand the government's eventual change of course in late 2022. His annual letters from China remain widely read and praised by those looking to make sense of China.But Wang's work goes beyond helping Western readers decode China. He wants to challenge them to think whether China's triumphs and missteps might also offer lessons for the United States. \"For decades, it was right and good for China to learn from the United States,\" he tells NPR in a recent interview, \"it is now time for the United States to learn a few things from China.\"WorldChina's lockdown protests and rising COVID leave Xi Jinping with '2 bad options'It is a provocative proposition in today's political climate in Washington. Yet, Wang insists that the U.S. and China \"are fundamentally alike: restless, eager for shortcuts, ultimately driving most of the world's big changes.\"He goes on to say: \"both countries are tangles of imperfection, regularly delivering — in the name of competition — self-beatings that go beyond the wildest dreams of the other.\"There are many thought-provoking observations like these in his book,Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future. For example, Wang notices that Chinese leadership is dominated by engineers, while America's governing class is the preserve of lawyers — with a few generals and a handful of businessmen in the mix.This contrast, therefore, raises deeper questions in what some see as a \"new cold war\" between the world's two largest economies: Are these two societies, one led by lawyers the other by engineers, destined to clash? If so, what will it look like? And if not, can they ever learn from each other's strengths?NPR recently spoke with Wang to learn about his thinking on the current state of play between the U.S. and China.U.S. vs. China: Inside a great power rivalryHow China's growing industrial power buffers it from the trade warNPR: You use \"engineering state\" vs. \"lawyerly society\" to explain how China got ahead and America stagnated. But there was a period during China's reform era that some pro-reform intellectuals admired the fact that America's ruling class was proficient in procedures. Are they proven wrong?Wang:For decades, it was right and good for China to learn from the United States. It is now time for the United States to learn a few things from China. Some of China's most remarkable successes shine a way towards solving many of America's present problems. China has built vast numbers of new homes, expanded the scale of its mass transit infrastructure, has become the world's leader on the construction of clean technology deployment, and maintained a robust manufacturing base.

Edible insects in the form of wriggling maggots or hairy caterpillars are both delicacy and staple in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a central African nation of nearly 120 million people.In markets in the capital Kinshasa, tubs full of writhing white maggots line the alleyways, and women traders fry caterpillars, spiced with chili, over charcoal fires. \"The more you eat caterpillars, the more you'll have a long life,\" says Trésor Kisanbu, clutching a small plastic bag of fried caterpillars, in Kinshasa's largest market, Marché Liberté. \"It strengthens your muscles and your eyes, it's really organic,\" he adds.Villagers harvest fresh caterpillars and maggots from rotting tree trunks in forested areas in the Congolese interior. From there, they're sent by the boatload down the Congo River — the second-largest in Africa — for sale in Kinshasa's markets.\"People eat a lot of them,\" says Mamman Coco, who runs a stall overflowing with piles of maize flour, dried beans and edible insects, in the center of Kinshasa's sprawling central market.She points to the caterpillars' high protein and vitamin content as selling points, and the fact that they're organic.Crunchy caterpillars on sale in a market in Kinshasa.JUNIOR D.

This is the Lingala term for the larvae of palm weevils, a type of beetle that lives in palm trees.
