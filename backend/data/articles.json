It was where their two older children were born.Abdul sat next to Shahnaz comforting her as they drove over gravel tracks to reach help.\"But when we reached the clinic, we saw that it was closed. I didn't know it had shut down,\" he said, his face crumpling with agony.Warning: Readers may find some details in this article distressing.The clinic in Shesh Pol is one of more than 400 medical facilities that closed down in Afghanistan, one of the world's poorest countries, after the Trump administration cut nearly all US aid to the country earlier this year, in a drastic and abrupt move following the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).A single-storey structure with four small rooms, white paint peeling off its walls, the Shesh Pol clinic has USAID posters tacked up everywhere with information and guidance for pregnant women and new mothers.Aakriti Thapar / BBCShesh Pol maternity clinic is one of hundreds of medical facilities forced to close as a result of US aid cuts in AfghanistanIt doesn't look like much but in Badakhshan's mountainous, unforgiving terrain, where a lack of access has been a major reason for historically high maternal mortality rates, the clinic was a critical lifeline, part of a wider programme implemented during the tenure of the US-backed government in the country, to reduce maternal and newborn deaths.It had a trained midwife who assisted around 25-30 deliveries every month. It had a stock of medicines and injections, and it also provided basic healthcare services.Other medical facilities are simply too far from Abdul's village, and it was not without risk for Shahnaz to travel on bumpy roads. Abdul also didn't have money to pay for a longer journey - renting the taxi cost 1,000 Afghani ($14.65; £12.70), roughly a quarter of his monthly income as a labourer. So they decided to return home.\"But the baby was coming and we had to stop by the side of the road,\" Abdul said.Shahnaz delivered their baby girl in the car. Shortly after, she died, bleeding profusely. A few hours later, before she could be named, their baby also died.Aakriti Thapar / BBCAbdul spoke to the BBC about the traumatic deaths of his wife and newborn baby, who are buried in Shesh Pol\"I wept and screamed.

She and her siblings had been left sleeping in a holiday apartment while her parents, Kate and Gerry, went for dinner at a nearby restaurant.They had checked in on the children periodically until Kate discovered Madeleine was missing at around 22:00.Brückner is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman at her home in Praia da Luz in 2005.German authorities have said hewill be released by Wednesday.Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell said Brückner remains a suspect in the Met Police's own investigation into Madeleine's disappearance. He has been the prime suspect in the German and Portuguese investigations since 2020 and 2022, respectively.\"We have requested an interview with this German suspect but, for legal reasons, this can only be done via an International Letter of Request which has been submitted,\" Det Ch Insp Cranwell said.\"It was subsequently refused by the suspect.

He has several previous convictions, including for sexually abusing children in 1994 and 2016.Portuguese and German police conducted a fresh search between where the McCanns had been staying and addresses linked to Brückner in June this year, but thisyielded no breakthroughs.PA MediaInvestigators have been searching scrubland and abandoned buildings in the latest searches for Madeleine McCannIn 2023, investigatorscarried out searches near the Barragem do Arade reservoir, about 30 miles from Praia da Luz.Brückner spent time in the Praia da Luz area between 2000 and 2017 and had photographs and videos of himself near the reservoir.In October last yea",

The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests.Our BBC World Service investigation was told the reality is even darker.Young Ugandan women told us they had not expected to have to undertake sex work for Mr Mwesigwa. In some cases, they believed they were travelling to the UAE to work in places like supermarkets or hotels.At least one of Mr Mwesigwa's clients regularly asks to defecate on the women, according to \"Mia\", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, and who says she was trapped by Mr Mwesigwa's network.Mr Mwesigwa denies the allegations. He says he helps women find accommodation through landlords, and that women follow him to parties because of his wealthy Dubai contacts.We have also discovered that two women linked to Mr Mwesigwa have died, having fallen from high-rise apartments. Although their deaths were ruled as suicides, their friends and family feel the police should have investigated further.Mr Mwesigwa said the incidents were investigated by the Dubai police and asked us to contact them for information. They did not reply to our request.Outside of the UKwatch on YouTubeOne of the women who lost her life, Monic Karungi, arrived in Dubai from western Uganda.She found herself sharing a flat with dozens of other women working for Mr Mwesigwa, according to one of the women, who we are calling Keira, who says she lived with Monic there in 2022.\"[His] place was like a market… There were like 50 girls. She was not happy because what she expected is not what she got,\" Keira told us.Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita.\"He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,\" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled.\"Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,\" says Mia.\"That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading ",

    "content": "Struggling with brain fog? Here's how to fix it10 hours agoShareSaveYasmin RufoBBC NewsShareSaveBBCWhen life gets busy and stress levels rise, it's not uncommon to find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there, losing your train of thought mid-sentence or struggling to stay focused on simple tasks.Especially after the weekend, it can be hard to get back into work or study mode.This mental cloudiness is often called brain fog and while it isn't a medical condition in itself, it refers to a collection of cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness.Common causes of it can include menopause or perimenopause, but it can also strike when you've got too much on your mind.Medical doctor and Morning Live expert, Dr. Tharaka has these four tips and a special acronym to help cut through the haze.1. Be kind to yourselfBrain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping.Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched.Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it.If you are concerned then you should contact your GP.2. Create routinesReduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory.Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, \"What am I doing today?\"It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making.3. Take breaksGetty ImagesTaking some time between tasks can help reset your brain and focusIt's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room.But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely.Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly.Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next.4. Use calendars and remindersTrying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness.Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space.Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores.This means you're not constantly thinking, \"What do I need to remember next?\"SwansGetty ImagesStaying hydrated and eating whole foods can help clear brain fogAlongside these practical daily strategies, Dr T also recommends using his Swans acronym to support brain health and sharpen f",

Baroness Amos says she will aim to produce interim findings around Christmas.The review will examine the experience of families and staff within England's struggling maternity services and investigate why the recommendations from previous maternity inquiries in Morecambe Bay, East Kent, and Shrewsbury and Telford have not led to sustained improvements.Past inquiries have revealed issues including ignoring women's voices, poor leadership, a failure to learn from safety incidents and a toxic culture. Yet families are still repeatedly reporting substandard care.There will also be \"particular attention\" paid to examining why black and Asian families have noticeably poorer outcomes, Baroness Amos said.The Department of Health said the trusts had been chosen based on data analysis and the views of families, as well as to ensure a geographical and demographic mix.The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the focus on these",

He was 86.Hart died at his home in Los Angeles, according to his friend and co-author, Glenn Ballantyne. He had been in poor health since breaking his hip last year.Boyce and Hart were a prolific and successful team in the mid-1960s, especially for the Monkees, the made-for-television group promoted by Don Kirshner. They wrote the Monkees' theme song, with its opening shot, \"Here we come, walkin' down the street,\" and enduring chant, \"Hey, hey, we're the Monkees,\" and their first No. 1 hit, \"Last Train to Clarksville.\" The Monkees' eponymous, million-selling debut album included six songs from Boyce and Hart, who also served as producers and used their own backing musicians, the Candy Store Prophets, as session players.LawThe Monkees' drummer wants the FBI to quit monkeying around and hand over files\"I always credit them not only with writing many of our biggest hits, but, as producers, being instrumental in creating the unique Monkee sound we all know and love,\" the Monkees' Micky Dolenz wrote in a foreword to Hart's memoir,Psychedelic Bubblegum, published in 2015.As Boyce and Hart grew in fame and the Monkees took more control of their work, they pursued their own careers, releasing the albumsTest PatternsandI Wonder What She's Doing Toniteand appearing on such sitcoms asI Dream of JeannieandBewitched. They also were politically active. They campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy when he ran for president in 1968 and wrote the brassy \"L.U.V. (Let Us Vote)\" in support of the 26th Amendment, which in 1971 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.

It can also cause infertility and damage a koala's bladder to the point where the inner wall becomes inflamed and the marsupial passes blood, the organization said.The disease occurs in koalas multiple ways, including through mating, infected discharges and at birth. Baby koalas, known as joeys, can also catch chlamydia by eating pap, a substance produced by a mother that's similar to feces, if their mother is infected.Antibiotics have been used to treat the disease but it is not always effective and does not prevent future infections, according to the university. Antibiotics can also lead to gastrointestinal side effects that could hinder koalas' ability to digest eucalyptus leaves, which are the animals' main food source. Depending on the severity of the chlamydia and if it has progressed too far, euthanasia may be an only option.That's why scientists are optimistic about the vaccine.Sam Phillips, a senior researcher at the UniSC, said the vaccine has been tested on hundreds of wild koalas and koalas in captivity.\"It's based on Chlamydia pecorum's major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and offers three levels of protection – reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and, in some cases, reversing existing symptoms,\" Phillips said in a statement.The study led by Phillipsthat published last yearfound that the vaccine reduced signs of chlamydia during a koala's breeding age and decreased death from the disease by 64%.The university said the vaccine has been approved for production and widespread use by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).The agency told NPR it approved",

That is according to a 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For some indigenous communities, the ground on which they live is literally disappearing due to climate change. For the podcast \"Sea Change,\" member station reporters Eva Tesfaye and Sage Smiley looked at how tribes in both Louisiana and Alaska are making tough decisions about whether to stay or leave. Thanks to both of you for coming on.EVA TESFAYE, BYLINE: Thank you.SAGE SMILEY, BYLINE: Thanks for having us.DETROW: Let's start with this - why did you decide to focus on these two tribal communities, Nunapitchuk in Alaska and Pointe-au-Chien in Louisiana? Sage, let's start with you.SMILEY: Yeah, it really started with a conversation about how climate-driven coastal erosion actually looks pretty similar between Alaska and Louisiana, even though there's 4,000-ish miles between the two.DETROW: Yeah.SMILEY: And in that conversation, we noticed that relocation is something that tribes are thinking about in both places. So I flew out to the small Alaska native village of Nunapitchuk. The village plans on relocating because it's built on permafrost, ground that normally stays frozen year-round. But because of warming temperatures, that permafrost is melting, and the ground is becoming unstable, causing damage to houses and the town's infrastructure. One person I talked to about this was Gertrude Lewis, an elementary school teacher.(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"SEA CHANGE\")GERTRUDE LEWIS: My grandson, he stepped off the boardwalk, then he went knee deep. We had to pull him out. We lost his rubber boot (laughter).SMILEY: When you were a kid, could you play on the Tundra?LEWIS: Everywhere. Everywhere, we went everywhere.SMILEY: And now you have to stay on the boardwalk.LEWIS: Stay on the boardwalk.SMILEY: Because of the permafrost thaw, they're trying to relocate to land about a mile away that's owned by the local Native corporation, but getting the money to make the relocation happen is the hardest part.DETROW: Eva, what about you? You know, so much of coastal Louisiana is losing land due to erosion and sea-level rise. So why focus on this one particular community?TESFAYE: Yeah, I chose Pointe-au-Chien partly because it was right ",

The suspect, Tyler Robinson, is being held in a county jail. For more on this ongoing story, we're joined by NPR's Bobby Allyn in Salt Lake City. Good morning, Bobby.BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ayesha.RASCOE: So what's the latest in the case against the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson?ALLYN: Well, Utah County prosecutors said they intend to file aggravated murder charges against him on Tuesday, when he is also set to make his first court appearance. The charges carry the possible punishment of the death penalty if convicted. And most of what we know about the case so far is outlined in an affidavit that was filed after Robinson's arrest. And it says Robinson discussed with his family that Charlie Kirk was coming to Utah Valley University and that he really disliked Kirk, telling them that Kirk was, quote, \"full of hate and spreading hate.\" Authorities have video and photo evidence of what they say is his escape from a campus roof following the single shot that hit Kirk in the neck about 150 yards away and killed him.RASCOE: Now, this shooting happened at a public amphitheater with thousands in attendance. What security breakdowns may have allowed this to happen?ALLYN: Yeah, that's a huge question right now. There were only six police officers working the event. Kirk had his own security, but public safety experts have questioned whether a bigger security staff was needed at an event attended by more than 3,000 people. I talked to one of them, Keanan Cantrell (ph). He's a big Kirk fan and says he was about 50 feet away from the stage when Kirk was fatally shot. Cantrell says he thinks the university could have done more to fortify the event site.KEANAN CANTRELL: How the crap did security mess this up so badly that this was able to happen? No one checking bags, no metal detectors. We didn't see really any security.ALLYN: Now, Utah Valley University's campus has been closed since the shooting, but it's expected to reopen on Monday.RASCOE: Back to the suspected shooter, Robinson, what have we learned about him since he was apprehended?ALLYN: Yeah, Robinson grew up in a small town in southwe",

A redistricting race started by Trump continuesSeptember 14, 20256:00 AM ETLarry KaplowLoading...Missouri is the latest state redrawing its voting map to help Republicans hold onto their majority in the U.S. House. The state Senate voted Friday for a redistricting plan requested by President Trump that would help Republicans win a seat now held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver.NationalThe fight is on. How redistricting could unfold in 8 entangled statesThe plan now goes to Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe, who's expected to sign it. He had already called on lawmakers to approve the map he says reflects \"Missouri's conservative, common sense values.\"Missouri Democrats said this is a gerrymander that dilutes the votes of Black voters, especially around Kansas City, where voters will be split into different congressional districts.

He's calledon other Republican-led statesto redraw their mapstoo and the issue is rippling across the country.Trump got the redistricting race going this year in the face of high-stakes midtermsIn the last six midterm elections, the party that held the White Househas lost seatsin the U.S. House.
